# :star: Features

[(Back to top)](#React-Native-Infinity-Scroll)

Some key features are:

- Data extract from an API real: The Rick and Morty API (https://rickandmortyapi.com/)
- Loading state handling (UI and API calls)
- Handling the stop state, when the API has no more data.

The application is built using React Native with Expo framework.
The entire codebase is written using Typescript.
